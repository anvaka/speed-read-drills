# Speed Reading Drills

I'm a super slow reader. I bought this book [Tripple Your Reading Speed](https://www.amazon.com/Triple-Your-Reading-Speed-4th/dp/0743475763)
by Wade E. Cutler, hoping it helps me improve.

It's too early to say if it helps yet, but I'm practicing this exercise regularly.

In every drill you need focus your eyes on the _center_ letter of each line.
Then, without eye movement either to the left or right, read aloud or silently vocalize 
each letter in this order: _center_ letter, _left_ letter, _right-letter.

Then, move the eyes straight down to the next horizontal line and repeat the
process through the entire drill.

Only after you master Drill A should you begin working on Drill B. Practice
Drill B aloud and or silently, calling the letters in this order:
center, immediate left, immediate right, far left, far right.

After Drill B is master, go on to Drill C, D, and then E.

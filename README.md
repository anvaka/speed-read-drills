# Speed Reading Drills

I'm a super slow reader. I bought this book [Tripple Your Reading Speed](https://www.amazon.com/Triple-Your-Reading-Speed-4th/dp/0743475763)
by Wade E. Cutler, hoping it helps me improve.

It's too early to say if it helps yet, but I'm practicing this exercise regularly.

Note: the website has physical dimensions that matches those that I found in the book. The screenshot above is not representative as it may be scaled on your device.

## How to use this?

In [every drill](https://anvaka.github.io/speed-read-drills/) you need focus your eyes on the _center_ letter of each line.
Then, without eye movement either to the left or right, read aloud or silently vocalize 
each letter in this order: _center_ letter, _left_ letter, _right-letter.

Then, move the eyes straight down to the next horizontal line and repeat the
process through the entire drill.

Only after you master Drill A should you begin working on Drill B. Practice
Drill B aloud and or silently, calling the letters in this order:
center, immediate left, immediate right, far left, far right.

After Drill B is master, go on to Drill C, D, and then E.
